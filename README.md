Installation and Setup:

Prerequisites Python 3.8 or later MySQL Server Required Python libraries (listed below)

Install Required Libraries Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash pip install pandas mysql-connector-python sqlalchemy dash plotly scikit-learn statsmodels faker

Database Setup Ensure you have a MySQL database named sports_retail with the following tables: products sales reviews If these tables do not exist, you can use the synthetic_data.py script to generate and insert sample data.

Configuration Update the database connection details in data_processing.py with your MySQL credentials.

Project Structure app.py: Main entry point for the Dash application. data_processing.py: Contains functions for data retrieval and processing. forecasting.py: Contains functions for trend forecasting. clustering.py: Contains functions for customer segmentation. synthetic_data.py: Generates synthetic datasets for testing.

Usage

Running the Application To start the web application, run the following command:
bash python app.py The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ by default.

Features Revenue Forecasting: Visualize forecasted revenue trends for different product categories. Customer Segmentation: Analyze and visualize customer segments based on sales data.

User Interaction Filter Data: Use dropdown menus to filter data by time range or product categories. View Visualizations: Interactive graphs will update based on selected filters.

File Descriptions:

data_processing.py Contains functions for connecting to the MySQL database and retrieving data based on SQL queries.

forecasting.py Includes functions for forecasting trends using time series analysis and visualizing the results.

clustering.py Provides functions for customer segmentation and visualization based on sales data.

synthetic_data.py Generates synthetic data for testing and populates the MySQL database with sample data.

Troubleshooting:

Common Issues Table Not Found: Ensure that the required tables exist in your MySQL database. Use the synthetic_data.py script if necessary. Library Errors: Verify that all required libraries are installed correctly.

Error Logs Check the error messages in the terminal or command prompt for troubleshooting. Refer to specific error messages for guidance.
